# My Personal Website

### Description 
I created this website to simply showcase my other projects and social media links, I ended up making a more creative website then I originally planned for.  I chose to use React as I was planning on making a one page website with different scroll sections where I could utilize Reacts reausable components.

### Still in Progress
- Adding a seperate page for the rest of my smaller projects
- Having portfolio section have left and right variation
